Founded in 2016, Love Trust Respect is a Smule Group known for their members with their Unique singing style, buzzing Great Musics.
Starting as a Ladies Group with less than 10 members and we decided to collaborate with Male Smulers in 2018

Based in Singapore, our group explores a wide range of members from different countries Malaysia, Brunei & Indonesia, combining Smulers where we can learn different Genres of Musics.

As to date, LTR has more than 30 members.
We believe that music eases the mind. Learning music also helps to build character, such as improving oneâ€™s self-confidence."
